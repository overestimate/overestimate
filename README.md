i'm a developer with experience in go, python, and html5. most of my stuff never makes it on here ( :sweat_smile: ), but i do write neat little things.

<!-- "current projects" my ass :trolley:
**current projects:** i get bored sometimes, so i hop between projects. here's the ones currently in my cycle
 - voicetraining_toolbox, a webapp that provides the tools you need to voice train
 - steamwebapi-ts, an implementation of valve's web api in typescript.
-->

my pinned repos are either my most notable repos or ones im proud of.
