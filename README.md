i'm a developer with experience in go, python, and html5. most of my notable repos are partially complete side projects :sweat_smile:, but i do write little neat things.

**current projects:** i get bored sometimes, so i hop between projects. here's the ones currently in my cycle
 - voicetraining_toolbox, a webapp that provides the tools you need to voice train
 - steamwebapi-ts, an implementation of valve's web api in typescript.
